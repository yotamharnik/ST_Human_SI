# ST_Human_SI

Code and functions to process spatial transcriptomic (10X Visium) data (RAW) of the human small intestine. Run the main script to produce the processed data that was used to support the results in the manuscript "A spatial expression atlas of the adult human small intestine". 
The code to generate intermediary input is not provided and can be provided upon request. 

## Prerequisites

* Download RAW and intermediary input data files: [DOI 10.5281/zenodo.8396559](https://zenodo.org/record/8396559/files/Data.zip?download=1) 
* Unpack to the source directory of the main script.  
* Matlab R2023a

## Notes

* Crypt-villus gene expression zonation profiles can be browsed via our web-app: https://itzkovitzwebapps.weizmann.ac.il/webapps/home/session.html?app=Human_villus_zonation1_1
* processed zonation tables are provided as supplementary tables in the manuscript.
